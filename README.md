## Step 2: Mean Calculation

### Formula for Mean:
\[
Mean = \frac{\sum X}{N}
\]
Where:
- \( X \) = Sum of all values
- \( N \) = Total number of values

**Summing up the values:**
\[
22 + 25 + 25 + 28 + 30 + 31 + 33 + 35 + 36 + 36 + 38 + 39 + 40 + 41 + 42 + 43 + 45 + 45 + 45 + 46 + 47 + 48 + 49 + 50 + 51 + 52 + 53 + 55 + 55 + 56 + 58 + 59 + 60 + 61 + 62 + 63 + 65 + 66 + 66 + 68 + 69 + 70 + 71 + 72 + 73 + 75 + 75 + 75 + 78 + 80 = 2403
\]

**Total count (N) = 50**

\[
Mean = \frac{2403}{50} = 48.06
\]

## Step 3: Median Calculation

**Sorting the data:** (Already sorted above)

Since \( N = 50 \) (even number), the median is the average of the 25th and 26th values.

- 25th value = 51
- 26th value = 52

\[
Median = \frac{51 + 52}{2} = \frac{103}{2} = 51.5
\]

## Step 4: Mode Calculation

Mode is the value(s) that appear most frequently.

From the frequency table, the numbers appearing most frequently are:
- **45** (3 times)
- **75** (3 times)

Since there are two modes, this dataset is **bimodal** with modes **45 and 75**.

## Final Answers:
- **Mean** = 48.06
- **Median** = 51.5
- **Mode** = 45 and 75 (Bimodal)

# ANOVA Analysis of Physical Activity Programs

## Given Data:
| Source of Variation | Sum of Squares (SS) | Degrees of Freedom (df) |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Between Groups    | 180               | 2                  |
| Within Groups     | 540               | 15                 |
| Total             | 720               | 17                 |

## (a) State the Hypotheses:
### Null Hypothesis (H₀):
There is no significant difference between the mean blood pressure reductions among the three physical activity programs (X, Y, and Z).

### Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
At least one physical activity program results in a significantly different mean blood pressure reduction compared to the others.

## (b) Calculate the Mean Sum of Squares (MS):
The Mean Sum of Squares (MS) is obtained using:
\[
 MS = \frac{SS}{df}
\]

### Mean Sum of Squares for Between Groups:
\[
 MS_{Between} = \frac{SS_{Between}}{df_{Between}} = \frac{180}{2} = 90
\]

### Mean Sum of Squares for Within Groups:
\[
 MS_{Within} = \frac{SS_{Within}}{df_{Within}} = \frac{540}{15} = 36
\]

## (c) Compute the F-ratio:
The F-ratio is calculated using:
\[
 F = \frac{MS_{Between}}{MS_{Within}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
 F = \frac{90}{36} = 2.5
\]

## (d) Determine Significance at 5% Level:
To determine significance, we compare the calculated F-value with the critical F-value from the F-distribution table at \( \alpha = 0.05 \) with \( df_{Between} = 2 \) and \( df_{Within} = 15 \).

Using an F-table, the critical value for \( F(2,15) \) at 5% significance level is **3.68**.

Since \( F_{calculated} = 2.5 \) is **less than** \( F_{critical} = 3.68 \), we **fail to reject the null hypothesis (H₀)**.

## (e) Interpretation of the Result:
Since the F-ratio (2.5) is smaller than the critical value (3.68), there is **no significant difference** between the mean blood pressure reductions for the three physical activity programs at the 5% significance level. This suggests that the effect of the different programs on blood pressure reduction is statistically similar.
